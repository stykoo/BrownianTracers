This software is a computer program whose purpose is to simulate the
motion of interacting Brownian particle, some of them being driven by
an external force.

This software is governed by the CeCILL license under French law and
abiding by the rules of distribution of free software.  You can  use,

software by the user in light of its specific status of free software,
that may mean  that it is complicated to manipulate,  and  that  also
therefore means  that it is reserved for developers  and  experienced
professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore
encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their
